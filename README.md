Check [this](./docs/laod_testing.md) on how to run load testing for your OTA server in your deployment infrastructure.

## Local Development

1. Clone this fork and install dependencies:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jmzp/xavia-ota-by-jmzp.git
   cd xavia-ota-by-jmzp
   yarn install
   ```

2. Copy the example local env file:

   ```bash
   cp .env.example.local .env.local
   ```

3. Configure your environment variables in `.env.local`. The minimal required configuration is:

   ```env
   HOST=http://localhost:3000
   BLOB_STORAGE_TYPE=local
   DB_TYPE=postgres
   ADMIN_PASSWORD=your-admin-password
   PRIVATE_KEY_BASE_64=your-base64-encoded-private-key
   POSTGRES_USER=postgres
   POSTGRES_PASSWORD=postgres
   POSTGRES_DB=releases_db
   POSTGRES_HOST=localhost
   POSTGRES_PORT=5432
   ```

   **For Supabase Storage (Recommended for production):**

   ```env
   BLOB_STORAGE_TYPE=supabase
   SUPABASE_URL=your-supabase-url
   SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-supabase-anon-key
   SUPABASE_BUCKET_NAME=your-bucket-name
   ```

4. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   yarn dev
   ```

The server and admin dashboard will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

Refer to [Storage & Database Configuration](./docs/supportedStorageAlternatives.md) for more configuration options.

## Code Signing

The code signing is done using a private key. The private key is used to sign the updates. The client uses a certificate to verify the signature of the update.

To read more about code signing for your app and how you can generate the secrets, please refer to the [expo code signing documentation](https://docs.expo.dev/eas-update/code-signing/).

## React Native app configuration

To use the OTA updates in your React Native app, please refer to the [expo-updates configuration](https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/sdk/updates/).

‚ö†Ô∏è The `updates.url` parameter in the [app config](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/configuration) should be set to `https://your-domain-name/api/manifest`. Notice the `/api/manifest` path. Otherwise, you will get the HTML page. ‚ö†Ô∏è
See docs on the `updates.url` parameter [here](https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/config/app/#url).

## Publish App Update

We provide a simple script `build-and-publish-app-release.sh` in the `scripts` folder to build and publish your app updates, copy it to your RN app root folder and run it from there:

```shell
./build-and-publish-app-release.sh <runtimeVersion> <your-xavia-ota-url>
```

> **Important**: Make sure the runtime version is the same as the one you use in your expo-updates config in your app.
> Refer to the [React Native app configuration](#react-native-app-configuration) for more information.

Example:

```shell
./build-and-publish-app-release.sh 1.0.0 http://localhost:3000
```

This script will:

1. Build your app using `expo export`
2. Package the update with metadata
3. Upload it to your Xavia OTA server

The script will show you the commit hash and message for confirmation before uploading.

> **Note**: Make sure the script is executable (`chmod +x scripts/build-and-publish-app-release.sh`)

## Rollbacks

We use a simple rollback-forward mechanism. When a new update is published, it becomes the "active" update and the previous update, let's call it "inactive" update, is still available in your server but not served to the clients.

If anything goes wrong with the active update, and you want to rollback to the inactive one, you can simply click a button in the admin dashboard.

What happens behind the scenes is that we copy the inactive update with a new timestamp and push it to the front of the queue of updates, effectively making it the new active update.

## Admin Dashboard

For more information about the admin dashboard, please refer to the [Admin Dashboard](./docs/adminPortal.md) documentation.

## FAQ

<details>
<summary>

### How is this different from EAS Updates?

</summary>
Xavia OTA is a free, self-hosted alternative to EAS Updates. While EAS Updates is a managed service that costs massively for growing apps, Xavia OTA can be deployed anywhere and is completely free. Both implement the same expo-updates protocol.
</details>

<details>
<summary>

### How is this different from self-hosted CodePush server?

</summary>

The self-hosted CodePush server is tightly coupled with the Azure ecosystem and requires Azure App Service & Azure Blob Storage for production deployments and an Azurite emulator for local development.

Xavia OTA, on the other hand, is completely independent and can be deployed anywhere - whether that's your own infrastructure, AWS, GCP, or any other cloud provider. Additionally, Xavia OTA implements the expo-updates protocol which is more widely adopted in the React Native ecosystem compared to CodePush's protocol.

</details>

<details>
<summary>

### Can I use this with bare React Native apps?

</summary>

This a "yes and no" type of answer. While you can use Xavia OTA with bare React Native apps, you need to configure expo-updates in your app and point it to your Xavia OTA server. Unfortunately, that means you will also need to add a small footprint of the Expo framework to your app as well.

So the "yes" part is for the ability to use Xavia OTA updates with bare React Native apps that haven't been created with Expo, and the "no" part is for the fact that you will need to ship the Expo SDK with your app from now on. The good thing is that you will not need to use any managed Expo services like EAS Build or EAS Submit to use expo-updates in your RN app with Xavia OTA.

> [!NOTE] This is fun!
> This problem might be worth working on by the community. The expo-updates protocol is designed to be agnostic to the underlying SDK that you use to build your app. So it should work with any RN app - no matter how bare-bones it is. The only client-side implementation for expo-updates protocol that we know of is the one made by Expo themselves. Xavia OTA implements the expo-updates protocol on the server side and we would love to see the same on the client side. If you are interested in working on this, here are some pointers:

1. Expo-updates [protocol specification](https://docs.expo.dev/archive/technical-specs/expo-updates-0/)
2. Expo-updates [client implementation](https://github.com/expo/expo/tree/main/packages/expo-updates)
